            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients: </strong>In a bowl, combine 1 cup of flour,
            2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 teaspons of baking powder, and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix Wet Ingredients: </strong>In another bowl, whisk together 1 cup of milk,
            1 large egg, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine: </strong>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. 
                Stir until just combined; it's okay if there are small lumps.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook: </strong> Get a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. 
                Cook until bubbles form on top and edges look set, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve: </strong> Stack pancakes on a plate and serve warm with syrup, fruit, or your favorite toppings!
